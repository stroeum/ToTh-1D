# Townsend
 1-D Generalization of Townsend breakdown
* All files are added for a simulation.
* Run main.mlx to obtain solutions for Townsend breakdown parallel plates, coaxial cylinders, and concentric spheres in Earth, Mars, Titan, and Venus atmospheres.
* The cross-sections are in the data directory.
* All files used for comparison with experimental data are provided as .png files and .mat (in MATLAB data file format, both sorted and unsorted).
- AuthorYYYY.png is the file that was used to extract experimental data.
- AuthorYYYY_orig.mat is the file that contains the raw, unsorted, extracted experimental data.
- AuthorYYYY.m or AuthorYYYY.mlx are the files that was used to sort the experimental data.
* macOS/linux users should use bolsigminus in alpha_eff.m.
* Windows users should use bolsigminus in alpha_eff.m.
